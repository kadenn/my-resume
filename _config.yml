about_content: |
  Hi, my name is Kagan, I’m a full stack web developer with over 2 years of experience currently specialising in back end development.
  I was always interested in computers since I was a kid.
  My interest in servers started when I created my own Minecraft server to play with my friends.
  Then I turned an unused computer into a server and even made some money from it.
  As I grow up, I continued to learn new things.
  I studied computer engineering in college to turn my passion into a career.
  I can quickly learn the topics that serve my purpose. 
  I know that learning and memorizing are not the same thing.
  I always try to train my mind to think instead of memorizing things.

  I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new. 
  The things that I currently have the most experience working with are: <mark>Go</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>Docker</mark>, <mark>GCP</mark>, <mark>TypeScript</mark> and <mark>React</mark>
