about_content: |
  Hi, my name is Kagan, and I'm a full stack web developer with 6 years of experience.
  I enjoy developing full stack web applications using the latest technologies to translate business requirements and logic into code.
  My areas of expertise include: <mark>VueJS</mark>, <mark>JavaScript</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Docker</mark>, and <mark>Golang</mark>.

  I've been interested in computers since I was a child.
  My passion for programming began when I created my own Minecraft server to play with friends.
  I pursued a degree in computer engineering to turn my passion into a career.
  
  I'm adept at learning and implementing new concepts and tools quickly.
  I believe in understanding concepts rather than memorizing them, and I always strive to think critically and creatively.

        *looksounique is a web app that lets users design and print custom AI-generated t-shirts. 
        Despite using advanced technology, it faced issues with payment processing, leading to its deactivation. 
        A demo version is still available at looksounique.com for demonstration purposes.*

        - I started a side project to create a web app that makes designing and printing unique AI-generated t-shirts easy. Using Vue, Vite, and Nuxt 3, I deployed it on Cloudflare Pages with Server-Side Rendering for better performance and SEO.

        - The app integrated the Stable Diffusion API for creating designs, used Stripe for payments, and Cloudflare R2 for storing images. Despite its advanced tech and innovative idea, the project hit snags in the validation phase, resulting in the deactivation of its payment functions.

        - This project is no longer active or maintained; however, a demo version of the web app is still available for demonstration purposes at looksounique.com
