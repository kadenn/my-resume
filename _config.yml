  Hi, my name’s Kagan and I’m a back end developer.
  I was always interested in computers since I was a kid.
  My interest in servers started when I made my own Minecraft server to play with my friends.
  Then I turned an unused computer into a server and even made some money from it.
  As I grow up, I continued to learn new things.
  I studied computer engineering in college to turn my passion into a career.
  Now I have more than 2 years of work experience.
  I worked on web development mostly.
  I can quickly learn the topics that serve my purpose. 
  I know that learning and memorizing are not the same thing.
  I always try to train my mind to think instead of memorizing things.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Go</mark>, <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Docker</mark>
