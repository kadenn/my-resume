about_content: |
  Hi, my name is Kagan, I’m a full stack web developer with over 2 years of experience.
  I enjoy developing applications using the latest technologies to translate business requirements/logic into code.
  The things that I currently have the most experience working with are: <mark>Go</mark> <mark>Python</mark> <mark>Docker</mark> <mark>Microservices</mark> <mark>TypeScript</mark> <mark>React</mark>

  I was always interested in computers since I was a kid.
  My interest in programming started when I created my own Minecraft server to play with my friends.
  As I grew up, I continued to learn new things.
  I studied computer engineering in college to turn my passion into a career.
  I am able to learn and implement new concepts/tools quickly and easily. 
  I know that learning and memorizing are not the same thing.
  I always train my mind to think instead of memorizing things.

  I am currently living in Turkey, but as I am a British citizen, **I have a residence and work permit in the UK.**
