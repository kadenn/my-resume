about_content: |
  Hi, my name is Kagan, and I'm a full stack web developer with over 4 years of experience.
  I enjoy developing full stack web applications using the latest technologies to translate business requirements and logic into code.
  My areas of expertise include: <mark>VueJS</mark>, <mark>JavaScript</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Docker</mark>, and <mark>Golang</mark>.

  I've been interested in computers since I was a child.
  My passion for programming began when I created my own Minecraft server to play with friends.
  As I grew older, I continued to learn and explore new technologies.
  I pursued a degree in computer engineering to turn my passion into a career.
  I'm adept at learning and implementing new concepts and tools quickly.
  I believe in understanding concepts rather than memorizing them, and I always strive to think critically and creatively.
